### v2.2.3

Bug fixes:

- Improved compatibility of grpcweb-transport with TypeScript >= 4.1.5 and skipLibCheck=false,
  see #248


### v2.2.2

New Features:

- For generic servers, support custom contexts, see #201.  
  Thanks to @be9 for the contribution.


### v2.2.1

Bug fixes:

- server_generic option stopped working, see #202.  
  Thanks to @sessfeld for the contribution.


### v2.2.0

New features:

- Add the plugin option `ts_nocheck` to support most strict compiler options in userspace, see #152.
- The new plugin option `add_pb_suffix` adds the suffix `_pb` to all file names, see #186.
- Add service/method name to RpcError, see #197  
  Thanks to @jcready for the contribution.
- Support JavaScript output via plugin option `output_javascript`, see #200.


Bug fixes:

- Use TextDecoder API for decoding UTF-8 from binary data, see #184.  
  We have been using protobuf.js' algorithm to decode UTF-8, but it has had [bugs](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/pull/1486)
  in the past. For best possible compatibility, we have switched to the TextDecoder API.
  See [MANUAL](./MANUAL.md#utf-8-decoding) for details.


### v2.1.0

New features:

- Add keep_enum_prefix plugin option #187
- json: Small performance improvement when encoding to JSON, see #191

Note: In the past, protobuf-ts only had patch releases and major releases. Going forward, protobuf-ts will bump the minor version for 
releases that add features. 


### v2.0.7

New features:

- json: Ignore unknown enum values #170  
  Thanks to @whs for the contribution.

Bug fixes:

- Update parseTrailer function to support empty trailers & trailers with colon in content #168  
  Thanks to @wielski for the contribution.


### v2.0.6

Bug fixes:

- Naming collisions with message named Object #161  
  Thanks to @joeflatt for the report.


### v2.0.5

- Use Symbol.for() to define MESSAGE_TYPE, see #151  
  Thanks to @be9 for the contribution.


### v2.0.4

New features:

- Do not unnecessarily copy read data in BinaryReader, see #148  
  Note that it is now strictly necessary to respect the offset of the underlying buffer 
  of byte fields.
- Add `force_exclude_all_options` plugin option, see #126  
  Thanks to @optiman for the suggestion.

Bug fixes:

- The new symbol property `MESSAGE_TYPE` broke user unit tests. The property was set to non-enumerable.  
  Thanks to @jcready for the feedback. 


### v2.0.3

New features:

- All messages created with `create()` now have a symbol property `MESSAGE_TYPE` 
  that provides access to the messages type. Use `containsMessageType(yourMessage)` 
  to check if a message contains its type and access it with `yourMessage[MESSAGE_TYPE]`.
  
  Note that this is an experimental feature - it is here to stay, but implementation 
  details may change without notice.
  
  Many thanks to @odashevskii-plaid for the contribution.


Bug fixes:

- Generated `create()` method for speed optimized code got left behind in #55  
  Thanks to @odashevskii-plaid for the find!

  Thanks to @doochik for bringing it up.

  a `peerDependency` `>=3.8.3`. Thanks to @ghaiklor-wix for the 
  suggestion.

  Thanks to @DiogoMaMartins for the bug report.

- Proto fields with `[jstype = JS_NORMAL]` were generated as `string` when the `long_type_string` plugin parameter was used. (See #27)


#### Breaking changes

- `RpcOptions` takes a `timeout` property now. `deadline` property
  has been removed. See #138 for details.

- The "response" property of ServerStreamingCall and BidiStreamingCall has been renamed "responses".

- The "request" property of ClientStreamingCall and BidiStreamingCall has been renamed "requests".

- plugin option "disable_service_client" was renamed to "force_client_none"

- clients are generated into separate files (see #55)

- The `cancel` method of RPC was removed, see #9  
  As a replacement, you can pass an `AbortSignal` in the call options instead.


#### Breaking changes in non-user-facing code

- runtime: The MessageInfo interface requires the new "options"
  property.

- plugin-framework: IDescriptorInfo.isMessageField() no longer
  returns true for GROUP field type.

- grpcweb-transport: The function `readGrpcWebResponseHeader()` no longer
  returns the format.

- grpcweb-transport: The function `readGrpcWebResponseBody()` no longer takes
  the format as an argument. Instead, it now takes the content-type response
  header value and determines the format on its own.

- The function `mergeExtendedRpcOptions` was renamed to `mergeRpcOptions`.

- RpcOutputStream callback `onNext` is now called with `complete = false` on error.

- the methods `stackUnaryInterceptors`, `stackServerStreamingInterceptors`,
  `stackClientStreamingInterceptors`, `stackDuplexStreamingInterceptors` are
  now deprecated. Use `stackIntercept` instead.



### v2.0.0-alpha.30

Breaking changes:

- `RpcOptions` takes a `timeout` property now. `deadline` property 
  has been removed. See #138 for details.


### v2.0.0-alpha.29

Bug fixes:

- @protobuf-ts/grpc-transport & @grpc/grpc-js dependency, see #136.  
  Thanks to @hugebdu for the report.

  plugin output sizes, see #134.

New features:

- Add oneof accessor / mutator functions, see #129


Cleanup:

- Rename plugin parameters to "plugin options".  
  The code generator request only accepts a single parameter string, 
  but this should be considered an implementation detail. `protoc` 
  uses `--ts_opt`, so we should speak of options, not parameters.


### v2.0.0-alpha.27

  and missing content-type header, see #102.  
  Thanks to @frederikhors for the bug report.
  
Breaking changes:

- grpcweb-transport: The function `readGrpcWebResponseHeader()` no longer

### v1.0.10 Bugfix for jstype = JS_STRING field option for speed optimized code

This patch fixes a bug in the plugin: The field option jstype = JS_STRING 
would generate invalid code for optimized speed. 

The problem only surfaces if the plugin parameter long_type_string
is *not* set and code is optimized for speed (instead of for code size).
See PR #29


### v1.0.9 Bugfix for jstype = JS_STRING field option

This patch fixes a bug in the plugin: The field option jstype = JS_STRING 
would still generate an interface with a bigint property. The problem only 
surfaces if the plugin parameter long_type_string is *not* set.  
See PR #28


### v1.0.8 Bugfix for Safari 14 bigint detection

This patch fixes issue #24

Thanks to @pedelman and @pzeinlinger for the bug reports!


### v1.0.7 Bugfix for RangeError in google.protobuf.Timestamp.fromDate()

This patch fixes a bug in the method google.protobuf.Timestamp.fromDate(). 
See issue #22


### v1.0.6 Support protoc install on older node versions

This patch fixes issue #16.

Thanks to @Caffeinix for bringing the issue up.


### v1.0.5 Bugfix for name clash with global Error object

This patch fixes a bug in the speed-optimized generated code.
The generated code for a message named "Error" would not compile.

Thanks to @pedelman for the contribution!


### v1.0.4 Compatibility with react

Previous releases were using const enums. They are incompatible with the compiler option "isolatedModules" used by react.

This release:

- changes all const enum declarations to plain enum
- updates generated reflection information to numerical literal with a comment to keep code size small
- activates compiler option "isolatedModules" for the "test-generated" package to cover regressions

Thanks to @pedelman for bringing this issue up!



### v1.0.3 Bugfix for missing custom field options

This patch fixes issue #2

This patch fixes issue #1


### v1.0.0 First release

This is the first public release of protobuf-ts.
