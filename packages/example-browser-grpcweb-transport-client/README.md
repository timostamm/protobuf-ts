@protobuf-ts/example-browser-grpcweb-transport-client
=====================================================

This is a simple gRPC-web client using @protobuf-ts/grpcweb-transport.

The client is generated by @protobuf-ts/plugin without any additional
parameters. A GrpcWebFetchTransport from the package @protobuf-ts/grpcweb-transport 
is used to communicate over gRPC-Web.

The client will call the [Eliza demo service](https://connectrpc.com/demo/), 
which serves gRPC-Web.

To run the client, run `npm start`.
