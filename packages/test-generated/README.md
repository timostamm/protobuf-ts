@protobuf-ts/test-generated
===========================

Automated tests for code generated by the protobuf-ts plugin. 

To cover plugin options that affect code generation, tests are repeated
for the most common combination of options: The directory "default" 
tests code generated without any option. The directory 
"force_optimize_code_size,long_type_string" tests code generated with 
the options `force_optimize_code_size`, and `long_type_string`.

Test files in "default/spec" are automatically copied to all other 
directories. This ensures that all options pass these tests. 
Directories may include additional tests.
