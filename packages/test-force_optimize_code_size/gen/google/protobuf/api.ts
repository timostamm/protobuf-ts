/**
 * Declares an API Interface to be included in this interface. The including
 * interface must redeclare all the methods from the included interface, but
 * documentation and options are inherited as follows:
 *
 * - If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation
 *   string of the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited
 *   from the original method.
 *
 * - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
 *   visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
 *   inherited.
 *
 * - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
 *   modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
 *   version of the including interface plus the [root][] path if
 *   specified.
 *
 * Example of a simple mixin:
 *
 *     package google.acl.v1;
 *     service AccessControl {
 *       // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     package google.storage.v2;
 *     service Storage {
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);
 *
 *       // Get a data record.
 *       rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * Example of a mixin configuration:
 *
 *     apis:
 *     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
 *       mixins:
 *       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
 *
 * The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
 * also declared with same name and request/response types in
 * `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
 * see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inheriting
 * documentation and annotations as follows:
 *
 *     service Storage {
 *       // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 *       }
 *       ...
 *     }
 *
 * Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.
 *
 * If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
 * relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:
 *
 *     apis:
 *     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
 *       mixins:
 *       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
 *         root: acls
 *
 * This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:
 *
 *     service Storage {
 *       // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 *       }
 *       ...
 *     }
