@protobuf-ts/example-node-grpcweb-transport-client
==================================================

This is a simple gRPC-web client using @protobuf-ts/grpcweb-transport.

The client is generated by @protobuf-ts/plugin without any additional 
parameters. A GrpcWebFetchTransport from the package @protobuf-ts/grpcweb-transport 
is used to communicate over gRPC-web.

The client will call the [Eliza demo service](https://connectrpc.com/demo/),
which serves gRPC-Web.

To run the client, run `npm start`.
