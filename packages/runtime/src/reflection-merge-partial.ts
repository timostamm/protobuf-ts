/**
 * Copy partial data into the target message.
 *
 * If a singular scalar or enum field is present in the source, it
 * replaces the field in the target.
 *
 * If a singular message field is present in the source, it is merged
 * with the target field by calling mergePartial() of the responsible
 * message type.
 *
 * If a repeated field is present in the source, its values replace
 * all values in the target array, removing extraneous values.
 * Repeated message fields are copied, not merged.
 *
 * If a map field is present in the source, entries are added to the
 * target map, replacing entries with the same key. Entries that only
 * exist in the target remain. Entries with message values are copied,
 * not merged.
 *
 * Note that this function differs from protobuf merge semantics,
 * which appends repeated fields.
